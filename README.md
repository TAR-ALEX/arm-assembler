# arm-assembler
This is an aarch64, arm64, or armv8 assembler. The assembler is not standard and has a unique syntax, the best way to ovserve the syntax is through the examples provided in the project.

I do not anticipate to upgrade or contribute to this project in the near future, I welcome any contributions or bugfixes.
